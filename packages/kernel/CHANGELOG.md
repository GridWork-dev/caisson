# @caisson/kernel

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- e62c88d: Harvest slice-2 (ADR-0215): guardrails' `guard.ts` gains an unconditional `"secret"`
  `GuardCategory` — a credential-shaped span (AWS/GitHub/OpenAI keys, JWTs, PEM blocks, secret-named
  assignments, URL userinfo passwords) now blocks at the cheap pre-screen tier, before the (possibly
  outaged) `Moderator` ever runs, closing the named egress-secret asymmetry. The `scrubForEgress`/
  `looksLikeSecret` predicate moves to `@caisson/kernel` (`secret-scrub.ts`) — the shared zero-dep base
  both `guardrails` and `local-store` already depend on — so the predicate has exactly one
  implementation; `@caisson/local-store`'s `egress-guard.ts` re-exports it, keeping its public surface
  and golden-pinned scrub contract unchanged (internal-only move, patch). `@caisson/guardrails` also
  ships a new standalone FTC "4 Ps" dark-pattern presentation guardrail (`ftc4p.ts`): a pure heuristic
  evaluator scoring marketing/UI copy against prominence/presentation/placement/proximity for false
  urgency, forced continuity, confirmshaming, opt-out-framed enrollment, and drip pricing, optionally
  wrappable as a `Moderator` via `ftc4pModerator`.
- ccf8b10: Branded money types + rounding provenance (ADR-0212, harvest slice-2 serialized wave-2).
  Kernel gains `src/money.ts`: TS-native nominal `Cents`/`Credits`/`MicroUsd`/`MicroUsdPerCredit`
  brands (compile-time only, zero runtime cost), `asCents`/`asCredits`/`asMicroUsd`/
  `asMicroUsdPerCredit` constructors (throw `ValidationError` on a non-integer/negative input),
  the identity `unwrapMoney` DB-boundary marker, and the `RoundedMoney<TRaw,TResult>`
  `{raw, mode, result}` record; `centsToCredits` now returns `Credits` and
  `centsToCreditsProvenance` returns the round-DOWN provenance record. Credits: `GrantInput`/
  `DebitInput.amount` are `Credits`, both accept optional `rounding`, and the new
  `CREDIT_ROUNDING_MIGRATION_SQL` (appended as platform migration `0007_credit_rounding.sql` —
  never an edit to the checksum-pinned `CREDIT_SCHEMA_SQL`) adds nullable
  `rounding_raw`/`rounding_mode` to `credit_event` with a biconditional + mode-enum CHECK.
  Pricebook: `creditsPerCycle`/`credits`/`codegenRunCredits` are branded; re-exports
  `centsToCreditsProvenance`. ai-meter: `CostBreakdown` is branded and gains `roundingCredits`
  (`mode: "up"`, ADR-0060) which `reserve()`/`reconcile()` persist onto their ledger rows;
  `BUNDLED_PRICE_BOOK` gains the `openai/text-embedding-3-small` row (ADR-0213 —
  embedding pricing is config, not code; `PRICE_BOOK_VERSION` bumped to 2026-07-02).
  `apply-billing-event` grants stay exact table integers with NULL/NULL provenance
  (ADR-0089 §5); ADR-0007 integer-at-rest is untouched. ai-kit/cli: boundary mints +
  test fixture updates only.

### Patch Changes

- 549dd4e: Strix pentest remediation (ADR-0204). kernel: new shared SSRF guard (`ssrf.ts`) — literal denylist + async DNS resolve-recheck of every resolved IP, the DNS-rebinding defense (vuln-0004). alerting + ai-kit: dedupe onto the kernel guard and resolve-recheck at the outbound-fetch seam (alerting per fetch; ai-kit via an injected guarded `fetch` for custom provider baseUrls). billing: `purchase.completed` carries `lineItems: {priceId, quantity}[]` so a multi-item cart fulfills every paid line, not just the first (vuln-0005), and a `subscription_update` regression test (vuln-0002).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 9483a36: Initial public release (0.1.0) — publish-readiness flip (ADR-0111). The open Base substrate (Apache-2.0, tier `oss`) publishes to public npm; the commercial editions/primitives/generator (tier `paid`) publish to GitHub Packages restricted. Versions were aligned to 0.1.0 in lockstep with the registry ledger; this changeset records the 0.1.0 release and seeds the changeset-presence gate (ADR-0021).

### Patch Changes

- 69817a1: Expose `fetchWithTimeout` via a client-safe `@caisson/kernel/fetch` subpath export so browser bundles can honor the fetchWithTimeout rule without pulling the server-only barrel.
