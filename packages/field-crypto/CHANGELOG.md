# @caisson/field-crypto

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 9483a36: Initial public release (0.1.0) — publish-readiness flip (ADR-0111). The open Base substrate (Apache-2.0, tier `oss`) publishes to public npm; the commercial editions/primitives/generator (tier `paid`) publish to GitHub Packages restricted. Versions were aligned to 0.1.0 in lockstep with the registry ledger; this changeset records the 0.1.0 release and seeds the changeset-presence gate (ADR-0021).

### Patch Changes

- 72ffd85: Whole-repo audit remediation (rounds 1+2, ledger 2026-07-01): LemonSqueezy credit-grant idempotency keys off the stable resource composite (never webhook_id); BYOK zero-cost gated to a per-action allowlist, default metered (ADR-0198); AWS KMS driver honors per-tenant CMKs and refuses keyId-less crypto-shred (ADR-0197); BYOK baseUrl SSRF guard (https-only, private/metadata ranges rejected); request-span low-cardinality span names + scrubbed http.route; field-crypto-policy evidence collector emits sorted arrays (deterministic canonical body); entitlements free-view docstring corrected to ADR-0136.
- a07feb0: Fold the Stage-2 harvest primitives into the edition member pin maps (ADR-0178): Compliance now bundles
  `@caisson/alerting` + `@caisson/retention-runner`, and Agentic-Dev bundles `@caisson/tool-exec`, so buyers
  get them at the edition price (matches the ADR-0137 below-module-sum reprice).

  Also resolves standards-gate debt with no API change: `@caisson/auth`'s manifest now declares its real
  `@caisson/tenancy-rls` dependency (it imports it in `schema.ts`/`membership.ts`), and `@caisson/field-crypto`
  extracts the `KmsClient` port to a leaf `kms-port.ts` to break the `kms.ts` ↔ `kms-aws.ts` type cycle
  (dependency-cruiser `no-circular`). `KmsClient` is still re-exported from `kms.ts` for back-compat.
