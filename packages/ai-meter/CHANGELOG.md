## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 9483a36: Initial public release (0.1.0) — publish-readiness flip (ADR-0111). The open Base substrate (Apache-2.0, tier `oss`) publishes to public npm; the commercial editions/primitives/generator (tier `paid`) publish to GitHub Packages restricted. Versions were aligned to 0.1.0 in lockstep with the registry ledger; this changeset records the 0.1.0 release and seeds the changeset-presence gate (ADR-0021).

### Patch Changes

- 33bee35: Whole-repo audit round-4 remediation (ledger 2026-07-01): BYOK (tenant-key) inference now
  makes zero wallet movement while internal metering still runs, implementing ADR-0182/0198;
  provider-unreported token usage is kept distinct from genuine zero so reconcile settles at
  the reserved estimate instead of silently refunding a real call; the spend-window bucket is
  fixed at reserve and reused at reconcile so boundary-straddling calls no longer undercount
  the hard-cap breaker. Alerting webhook/Slack/Telegram destinations get an https-only +
  private/metadata-range SSRF guard at both the Zod boundary and the fetch seam, mirroring the
  ai-kit baseUrl policy. The retention_audit table gets fail-closed RLS via an append-only
  follow-up migration. The pg-boss production job driver now validates task name + payload
  schema on enqueue like its sibling drivers.
