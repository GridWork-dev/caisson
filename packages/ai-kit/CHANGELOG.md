# @caisson/ai-kit

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 59d332f: Edition seam-completion (ADR-0179..0185).

  - `@caisson/compliance`: OSCAL export lifted to v1.2.2 with a JSON→XML converter path (`oscal-export-xml`)
    and NIST-conformant SAR + POA&M output across all three frameworks (SOC2/HIPAA/EU-AI-Act) — finding
    status carries a constrained token + `remarks`, POA&M satisfies the `poam-items` min-1 XSD rule with a
    truthful "no open items" entry rather than a fabricated gap, and the root `props` block is dropped. Adds
    the AI-risk-register + field-crypto-policy collectors.
  - `@caisson/ai-kit`: BYOK key resolver (free-tier + edge-safe).
  - `@caisson/observability`: manual Bun-OTel request spans (`request-span`).
  - `@caisson/pricebook`: seam action export.

- 57170c5: Editions go live (ADR-0187 + ADR-0201/0202): live transports proven + retention escalation + support impersonation.

  - `@caisson/audit-worm`: `extendRetention` on the `ArtifactStore` port (strictly-monotonic, never
    shortens — ADR-0202), `escalateToCompliance` on the S3 backend behind the ADR-0051 three-belt gate,
    and the chain-evidenced `escalateRetention` helper (`retention.escalated` on the tenant chain;
    a chain-append failure fails the whole operation loudly). Live S3 Object-Lock proof in `live/`
    (`test:live`, self-skipping — ADR-0201).
  - `@caisson/ai-kit`: `openrouter`/`local`/`ollama` provider lanes moved to
    `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`, fixing the AI SDK v5 Responses-API default that would have POSTed
    live calls to `{baseURL}/responses` instead of `/chat/completions`; a baseUrl-less `local`/`ollama`
    lane now fails closed instead of silently calling api.openai.com. Live gateway proof in `live/`.
  - `@caisson/local-ai`: `createOpenRouterRentedTransport` — the hosted (non-BYOK, fully-metered)
    rented lane over OpenRouter's OpenAI-compatible wire, egress-guarded and strict-revalidated.
    Live rented + availability-gated ONNX proofs in `live/`.
  - `@caisson/compliance`: the support-impersonation kernel with a dual audit trail (ADR-0187) —
    time-bounded, reason-required sessions; operator + acting-as-tenant records linked by `sessionId`
    on the target tenant's WORM-anchored chain; `impersonation_session` migration (RLS + column-scoped
    GRANT); the impersonation evidence collector cited by both the SOC2 and HIPAA plans.

- 9483a36: Initial public release (0.1.0) — publish-readiness flip (ADR-0111). The open Base substrate (Apache-2.0, tier `oss`) publishes to public npm; the commercial editions/primitives/generator (tier `paid`) publish to GitHub Packages restricted. Versions were aligned to 0.1.0 in lockstep with the registry ledger; this changeset records the 0.1.0 release and seeds the changeset-presence gate (ADR-0021).

### Patch Changes

- 33bee35: Whole-repo audit round-4 remediation (ledger 2026-07-01): BYOK (tenant-key) inference now
  makes zero wallet movement while internal metering still runs, implementing ADR-0182/0198;
  provider-unreported token usage is kept distinct from genuine zero so reconcile settles at
  the reserved estimate instead of silently refunding a real call; the spend-window bucket is
  fixed at reserve and reused at reconcile so boundary-straddling calls no longer undercount
  the hard-cap breaker. Alerting webhook/Slack/Telegram destinations get an https-only +
  private/metadata-range SSRF guard at both the Zod boundary and the fetch seam, mirroring the
  ai-kit baseUrl policy. The retention_audit table gets fail-closed RLS via an append-only
  follow-up migration. The pg-boss production job driver now validates task name + payload
  schema on enqueue like its sibling drivers.
- 72ffd85: Whole-repo audit remediation (rounds 1+2, ledger 2026-07-01): LemonSqueezy credit-grant idempotency keys off the stable resource composite (never webhook_id); BYOK zero-cost gated to a per-action allowlist, default metered (ADR-0198); AWS KMS driver honors per-tenant CMKs and refuses keyId-less crypto-shred (ADR-0197); BYOK baseUrl SSRF guard (https-only, private/metadata ranges rejected); request-span low-cardinality span names + scrubbed http.route; field-crypto-policy evidence collector emits sorted arrays (deterministic canonical body); entitlements free-view docstring corrected to ADR-0136.
