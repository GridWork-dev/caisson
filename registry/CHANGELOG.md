### Patch Changes

- 4fc006c: Admin paid-purchase revoke. service-license: `revokePurchaseAdmin` composes the
  existing source-scoped revoke helpers with the bounded clawback (`creditsGrantedBySource -
creditsClawedForSource`) under `withAdminWrite` in one transaction, a new `purchase_revoke`
  `admin_action_log` action + CHECK migration, and a `license-revocation-store` feeding the registry's edge deny-set. admin: a paid-revoke mutation card with an impact-preview read (active sources +
  projected claw) plus type-to-confirm, and the `/api/admin/entitlement/revoke-purchase` (+
  `/preview`) routes. registry: the Worker deny-set check (`revocation-list.ts`), wired
  fail-open into `entitlement-filter.ts`/`deploy-entry.ts` so a fetch/parse failure never blocks an
  install.

### Patch Changes

- ea52d1f: Add `@caisson/agent-runner` (new, ADR-0186): the sandboxed governed agent runner completing
  the Agentic-Dev "run agents safely" story. Spawns a headless agent CLI as a detached subprocess
  in an isolated worktree with a from-scratch scrubbed env — never spreads `process.env`; fixed
  non-secret passthrough allowlist + only the target provider's key + isolated HOME/config dir
  (ship-blocking leak-guard test, unit + end-to-end through a real spawn). Provider-agnostic
  config `{ binary, baseUrlEnv, authEnv, model, args }` with a worked Claude-CLI profile
  (`--strict-mcp-config`, no credentialed MCP); durable `.jsonl` transcript surviving launcher
  exit; run registry `spawn`/`tail`/`status`/`kill`/`list`/`finalReport` with `.strict()`-validated
  meta reads and a structured report (tool calls, files touched, final result) parsed from the
  transcript. Registered in the `apps/agent-dev` demo composition (`runAgentRunnerDemo`), and
  folded into the Agentic-Dev edition's `members` pin map + dependencies (ADR-0186 F5 edition-only
  SKU, the ADR-0178 tool-exec form).
- 904b15b: Post-merge consolidation sweep: repo links repointed to caisson-sh/caisson (site footer, JSON-LD, docs edit-links, llms.txt blob URLs), the audit-harness design-ui domain re-globbed from the removed apps/studio to the apps/admin design gallery, and stale SigNoz naming updated to the Grafana Cloud fleet sink (ADR-0177/0207). Docs/comments only apart from the design-ui glob fix; no behavior change to any runtime path.
